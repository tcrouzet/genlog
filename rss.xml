<p>The article discusses the existence of a giant cosmic void in our local universe, contradicting the cosmological principle. This void, named the KBC void, is about 2 billion light-years wide, defying standard cosmology laws. Observations suggest that matter may not be uniformly distributed, leading to regions of high and low densities. The void could explain conflicting observations about the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>The KBC void defies cosmology laws, 20% emptier than surrounding space. Observations show non-uniform matter distribution, contradicting the cosmological principle. Named the KBC void, it's 2 billion light-years wide. This void could resolve expansion discrepancies in our local universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://mindmatters.ai/2024/05/science-team-argues-consciousness-came-before-life/">Science Team Argues, Consciousness Came Before Life</a></p>
<p>This article discusses the hypothesis that consciousness may have preceded life, challenging the common belief that life came before consciousness. Stuart Hameroff, Anirban Bandyopadhyay, and Dante Lauretta propose this idea based on the Orch OR theory of consciousness, which suggests that consciousness arises from the collapse of quantum superpositions. They introduce the concept of "proto-conscious" objective reduction events in the early universe, theorizing that these events motivated purposeful behavior in simple organisms before the development of genes and brains. The team's theory aims to address the fundamental question of how life forms acquired goals, a key distinction between living and non-living entities.</p>

<p>Researchers in Australia discovered that by processing and adding charred coffee grounds to concrete, it could be 30 percent stronger, addressing environmental challenges related to coffee waste and sand extraction. The team pyrolyzed coffee waste to create biochar, which can incorporate itself into the cement matrix. They are testing the durability of the hybrid coffee-cement product under various stressors and exploring creating biochars from other organic waste sources.</p>

<h3>Texte généré</h3><p>I am on the terrace of my apartment, a cup of coffee in hand, observing the flea market below. The objects spread out on the tables are witnesses of a bygone era, relics of a past that no one wants to forget, but that everyone is trying to sell. I love these moments when the world seems to stand still, when time floats like a weightless particle.</p>
<p>I am forty years old, with salt-and-pepper hair and round glasses. I am an astrophysicist at the Paris Observatory, but I am mostly interested in the mysteries of consciousness and the universe. I spend my days juggling between the equations of general relativity and quantum theories, trying to unravel the secret of reality.</p>
<p>This morning, I read an article about the possibility that consciousness preceded life. I had intuited this for a long time, but reading Stuart Hameroff and Anirban Bandyopadhyay gives me a new perspective. What if consciousness is not the product of life, but its precursor? This idea troubles and attracts me.</p>
<p>As I descend the stairs to join the flea market, I run into Émile, my neighbor from the same floor, a ten-year-old boy with wide eyes. He loves spending time with me, especially when we build space bases with plastic bottles and tin cans.</p>
<p>"Hi, Émile! Do you want to help me find treasures?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Leonard!"</p>
<p>We spend the morning rummaging around, finding books, toys, gadgets. I buy an old telescope for a handful of figs, hoping to show Émile the stars.</p>
<p>Back home, I turn on my computer and connect to a network of astrophysicists. They are discussing the discovery of a cosmic void two billion light-years in diameter, the KBC, which challenges the cosmological principle that matter is uniformly distributed in the universe.</p>
<p>I delve into the data, pondering the implications of this discovery. If the KBC exists, the universe is much more complex and mysterious than I had ever imagined. Perhaps this cosmic void is related to primordial consciousness. Perhaps consciousness is a void, a space where ideas can be born and evolve.</p>
<p>In the evening, I climb to the roof with Émile. We point the telescope towards the sky, and I show him the stars, the galaxies.</p>
<p>"Do you see that star? It's KIC 8462852, around which an artificial megastructure could be orbiting. Some believe it's evidence of extraterrestrial life."</p>
<p>Émile's eyes widen. "Are there aliens, Mr. Leonard?"</p>
<p>I smile. "I don't know, Émile. The universe is so vast and mysterious that anything is possible."</p>
<p>We stay there, gazing at the stars. I wonder if in the cosmic void, another form of consciousness is observing the same stars, asking the same questions.</p>
<p>The next day, I am at the observatory for a meeting with my colleagues. We discuss the KBC and new theories on consciousness. I suggest that the cosmic void is a form of consciousness, a space where the universe can reflect on itself.</p>
<p>My colleagues look at me incredulously, but I feel like I'm onto something. Over the following weeks, I develop this idea, combining data on the KBC with theories of primordial consciousness. I write articles, participate in conferences, and gradually, my idea gains traction.</p>
<p>One evening, returning home, I find Émile sitting on the steps of the building, holding a box of rice and a bottle of Gatorade.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here, Émile?"</p>
<p>"I wanted to show you something, Mr. Leonard. Look, I built a new space base!"</p>
<p>I sit down next to him. "That's great, Émile. You know, sometimes the greatest discoveries start with small ideas."</p>
<p>We sit there, looking at the model, as the sun sets. I feel strangely at peace. Perhaps consciousness and the cosmic void are connected in a way I don't yet understand, but I will continue to search, to explore, to dream.</p>
<p>In this void, I find the infinite.</p>

<p>Scientists potentially detect alien structures called Dyson spheres around stars, emitting detectable infrared glow. Data analysis of seven red dwarfs within 900 light-years of Earth reveals unusual brightness, hinting at advanced civilizations. Freeman Dyson's 1960 theory suggests aliens could harvest star power using Dyson swarms. Further research identifies 53 similar cases up to 6,500 light-years away. Possible natural explanations include debris from planet formation or alignment with distant galaxies. Further studies aim to uncover the truth behind these mysterious signals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freethink.com/hard-tech/metamaterial">3D-printed “metamaterial” is stronger than anything in nature</a></p>
<p>Australian scientists create super strong, lightweight "metamaterial" inspired by plants like the Victoria water lily. The new material, made using advanced metal 3D-printing, has a lattice structure distributing load stress evenly. The metamaterial, fabricated from a titanium alloy, is 50% stronger than aerospace alloys. The team used laser powder bed fusion, a unique 3D printing technique, to create the metamaterial. Traditional manufacturing processes may hinder real-world applications initially, but as technology advances, wider implementation is expected.</p>

<p>Particle accelerators recreate early Universe moments, revealing Big Bang insights. Experiments illuminate Universe evolution into star-filled cosmos. Blend of theoretical and experimental physics enhances understanding of earliest epochs. Large Hadron Collider accelerates protons to recreate hot early Universe conditions. Experiments explore Universe's transition from particle to nuclear physics eras. Inflation epoch, a period of faster-than-light expansion, remains theoretical.</p>

<h3>Texte généré</h3><p>I wake up with that familiar backup anxiety that grips me from time to time, like an old memory. To take my mind off things, I open my news aggregator. An article hits me like a punch: scientists have reportedly detected Dyson Spheres around certain stars. Suddenly, the universe seems more exciting to me.</p>
<p>I go for a bike ride. My gravel bike makes me feel like I'm gliding, but it's been forty years since I've ridden a racing bike. I can't stop thinking about this discovery. What if it's true? What if we're not alone?</p>
<p>Back home, I read another article: Australian scientists have invented a metamaterial stronger than anything found in nature. Inspired by plants, it could revolutionize the construction of everything, from airplanes to skyscrapers. I start to imagine a world where these two discoveries intersect.</p>
<p>Another article catches my eye: physicists are using particle accelerators to recreate the universe's first moments. We are on the cusp of a new era, where science fiction becomes reality.</p>
<p>I read, take notes, make hypotheses. What if Dyson Spheres were built with this metamaterial? What if particle accelerators helped us understand how they function?</p>
<p>I start writing a novel. Scientists discover a Dyson Sphere built with this metamaterial, and they use a particle accelerator to understand its workings. But they uncover more than they bargained for. The Dyson Sphere is not just an energy source; it's also a time-travel machine.</p>
<p>I spend nights writing. Isa tells me I'm stifling doubt with too much rationality. She may be right, but I want my novel to be believable, to make the reader question things and prepare them to enter the realm of fiction.</p>
<p>I finish my manuscript. I send it to my publisher. He calls me a few weeks later. He wants to publish my novel. Perhaps I managed to convey some of the excitement I felt when reading those articles.</p>
<p>What if it were true?</p>

<p>An international team of astronomers discovered SPECULOOS-3 b, an Earth-sized planet orbiting an ultra-cool red dwarf star 55 light years away. The planet, tidally locked, takes 17 hours to orbit the star, which is colder, less massive, and less luminous than our sun. The SPECULOOS project, led by the University of Liège, aims to find exoplanets around ultra-cool dwarf stars using a global network of robotic telescopes. SPECULOOS-3 b was observed by telescopes worldwide, including the SPECULOOS South Observatory in Chile. Ultra-cool dwarf stars, common in the Milky Way, have long lifespans, potentially fostering life on their planets.</p>

<p>NASA's Spitzer instrument uncovers feeding habits of supermassive black hole in Andromeda galaxy, with structures matching simulations. Black holes in galaxies feed on gas, dust, and stars, exhibiting tidal disruption events with bright flashes. Some galaxies have active galactic nuclei, bright due to accretion discs emitting light across electromagnetic spectrum. Quiescent black holes like Sagittarius A<em> and M31</em> feed modestly, emitting steady light. Computer simulations and observations by Hubble and Spitzer confirm spirals of dust feeding M31*.</p>

<h3>Texte généré</h3><p>The universe reminds us of our insignificance, yet we continue to explore. The announcement of the discovery of SPECULOOS-3 b, an Earth-sized exoplanet, has the same effect on me as Proxima Centauri. I am eager to find another habitable planet, yet I mock us, as we are unable to take care of our own.</p>
<p>The spirals of matter plunging into the central black hole of the Andromeda galaxy fascinate me just as much. They remind me of the spirals of my nocturnal thoughts, where I try to connect black holes to consciousness. These phenomena, so distant from us, show our capacity to contemplate the infinite. They push us towards both humility and audacity.</p>
<p>We are explorers, seeking to understand, to surpass ourselves, to expand our territory, while remaining human beings. Ultimately, we seek a mirror for our soul.</p>

<p>The kitchen serves as a unique laboratory for exploring soft matter and complex fluids, leading to discoveries at the intersection of physics and chemistry. A study in Nature Communications by Sam Christianson, Carsen Grote, and others delves into the phenomenon of objects levitating in carbonated fluids, known as dancing raisins. This study unveils how objects like raisins rhythmically move up and down in carbonated fluids for extended periods. The formation of bubbles in carbonated beverages is a result of gas escaping when the fluid pressure drops upon opening, with surface tension and container rough patches enabling bubble growth. Raisins, with their wrinkly surfaces, are exceptional at inducing bubble formation and showcasing a lively dance in carbonated drinks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nanowerk.com/news2/space/newsid=65208.php">A new process for the synthesis of rare nuclei in the Universe? - Nanowerk</a></p>
<p>Scientists propose the νr-process, involving neutrinos and neutron-rich material, as a new nucleosynthesis process to explain the origin of p-nuclei in the solar system. This process allows for the production of rare isotopes like 92,94Mo, 96,98Ru, and 92Nb through neutrino catalyzed capture reactions. The νr-process operates in neutron-rich outflows in astrophysical explosions, converting neutrons bound in nuclei into protons with the help of neutrinos, producing neutron-deficient nuclei. The type of stellar explosion where the νr-process occurs is yet to be determined, with suggestions including magneto-rotational supernovae, collapsars, or magnetars.</p>

<h3>Texte généré</h3><p>Scientific exploration is like riding a bike on the Larzac plateau: we never really know where it will lead us, but the journey itself is worth the detour. I delved into three articles that, at first glance, seem as disparate as bottles of San Pellegrino and Gatorade used to build a model of an orbital base. Yet, upon closer inspection, they reveal a fascinating common thread: our relentless quest to understand the universe, from dancing grapes to superconductors, passing through the synthesis of rare nuclei.</p>
<p>The first article, on dancing grapes, reminds me that science can be playful and accessible, much like building a model from scratch with Émile. It is the wonder at everyday phenomena that drives us to explore further, to seek explanations beyond the obvious. Superconductors and the synthesis of rare nuclei, on the other hand, delve into the depths of matter and the universe, echoing reflections on neural networks and the modeling of the universe. These studies point towards a complex and beautifully structured reality, where each discovery brings us closer to a deeper understanding, yet inevitably raises new questions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these articles, much like excerpts from my journal, illustrate our innate desire to push the boundaries of our knowledge, to play with concepts to see where they can lead us. Whether by observing grapes in sparkling water, deciphering the mysteries of superconductivity, or proposing new nucleosynthesis processes, we are constantly in search of answers, knowing that each answer is just a gateway to new questions. In this infinitely complex universe, perhaps the greatest discovery is to realize that, no matter the size of the Russian doll we open, there will always be another, smaller or larger, to explore.</p>

<p>Throughout the Universe, a vast array of naturally occurring elements, from hydrogen to plutonium, exist. The origin of heavy elements like silver, iodine, tungsten, platinum, gold, mercury, and uranium has long puzzled scientists. In 2017, the detection of a neutron star-neutron star merger provided a breakthrough, revealing the creation of various heavy elements, including an astonishing amount of gold. However, recent studies suggest that neutron star mergers alone cannot explain the abundance of gold in the Universe. The periodic table elements' origins are diverse, with supernovae, merging neutron stars, and planetary nebulae playing crucial roles. When exploring the cosmos, assumptions are made based on observed data, but biases can arise from limited observations, highlighting the need for comprehensive data collection to improve our understanding of the Universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jpost.com/science/article-800095">Scientists perform research build robots that move like animals - The Jerusalem Post</a></p>
<p>Robotics engineers have long tried to create robots that can match animals in running abilities. Animals excel in agility, range, and robustness, traits robots struggle to replicate. Researchers compared the performance of engineering subsystems in running robots with their biological counterparts and found that animals still outperform robots at the whole system level. Despite the rapid progress in robotics, animals have a significant advantage due to millions of years of evolution. The study aims to guide future robot technology development towards better integration and control of existing hardware for improved efficiency and agility.</p>

<h3>Texte généré</h3><p>Gold and robots, two human quests, one to understand the universe, the other to conquer it. As I read these articles, I ponder our obsession with unraveling the mysteries of creation and mimicking nature. The discovery that neutron star mergers alone do not account for the abundance of gold in the universe reminds me that, despite our progress, we are still far from grasping cosmic complexity. Similarly, the endeavor to create robots that move like animals underscores our desire to match, or even surpass, natural evolution. Yet, in light of my daily reflections, these two articles lead me to consider that perhaps we are searching in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>The universe, with its black holes and exoplanets, and robotics, with its attempts to mimic life, seem to me to be two sides of the same coin. On one hand, our quest for knowledge drives us to explore the far reaches of space, seeking answers about the origin of gold, a symbol of our insignificance in the face of cosmic vastness. On the other hand, our ambition to recreate life, to build robots that move with the grace of an animal, reveals our desire for mastery over the natural world. These efforts, though commendable, prompt me to question our ability to appreciate the beauty of the unknown and to accept the limits of our understanding.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these explorations, whether cosmic or technological, reflect back on our own nature. They unveil our unquenchable thirst for knowledge and our desire to surpass our own limits. But perhaps, as my reflections on ethics, currency, or even art suggest, the true quest should not be to conquer the universe or surpass nature, but to better comprehend our place in the cosmos. As I have often thought, what truly matters is not so much what we discover or create, but what these quests reveal about us. "We do not turn to history to escape reality, but to navigate reality."</p>
