<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-us-copyright-office-loosens-up-a-little-on-ai/">How One Author Pushed the Limits of AI Copyright</a></p>
<p>Elisa Shupe, a retired US Army veteran, filed a copyright registration for her novel, "AI Machinations: Tangled Webs and Typed Words," created with OpenAI's ChatGPT. After the US Copyright Office initially rejected her application, Shupe appealed and ultimately secured copyright recognition for her work, which blends autofiction with advocacy for gender recognition. The USCO's approval acknowledges Shupe as the author of the AI-generated text's selection, coordination, and arrangement, setting a precedent for future AI-created works. Shupe, who faces cognitive impairments, sought an ADA exemption to copyright AI-generated content due to her disabilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/never-before-seen-quantum-hybrid-state-discovered-on-arsenic-surface">Never-Before-Seen Quantum Hybrid State Discovered on Arsenic Surface - ScienceAlert</a></p>
<p>Physicists discover unexpected hybrid quantum state on arsenic crystal surface during study of quantum topology. Topology, crucial for understanding wave-like properties of quantum matter, influences materials' behavior. Arsenic, a topological insulator simpler than bismuth, reveals new quantum states at room temperature. Researchers use scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy to observe surface and edge states on gray arsenic crystal, leading to the discovery of a unique hybrid state. This breakthrough could pave the way for novel quantum materials and technologies, expanding the frontier of material science and physics.</p>
<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-04-future-mars-exploration-supercomputers.html">Supporting the future of Mars exploration with supercomputers - Phys.org</a></p>
<p>The Department of Energy Office of Science's user facility supercomputers assist NASA engineers and scientists in simulating the challenging process of slowing down a large spacecraft as it approaches Mars' surface. Unlike robotic missions, human exploration requires landing much heavier vehicles without parachutes, relying instead on retro-propulsion technology. By using supercomputers like Summit at OLCF and software tools such as FUN3D, researchers can model the complex physics involved in retro-propulsion and the Martian environment, addressing the unique challenges of landing humans on Mars.</p>

<h3>Analyse</h3><p>Artificial intelligence, quantum physics, space exploration - three domains where humanity seeks to push its boundaries. I delve into them with my curiosity, skepticism, and taste for new technologies. The article on Elisa Shupe and her novel AI Machinations brings me back to my exploration of AI in literature. Like her, I question my role as an author in a world where machines can create in my place. The pursuit of innovation and transcendence is a recurring theme in my thinking.</p>
<p>The discovery of a hybrid quantum state of arsenic makes me reflect on the importance of topology in our perception of the world, a subject I have previously addressed. This advancement in quantum physics, much like the computational revolution whose beginnings I was reading about this morning, signifies our transition from an era of modeling to an era of data understanding. The exploration of Mars with the help of supercomputers illustrates our determination to conquer space, an ambition that fascinates me despite the challenges it poses. These attempts to master the universe, whether it be digital, quantum, or spatial, resonate with my desire to surpass the limits of creation and knowledge.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether through AI in writing, the discovery of new states of matter, or the simulation of challenges in space exploration, I observe that humanity is capable of innovating and exploring the unknown. These literary, scientific, or space adventures remind me that our quest for understanding and transcendence is endless. And if we are all in the same boat, we might as well row in the direction of the stars.</p>
