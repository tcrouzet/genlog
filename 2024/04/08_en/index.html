In my quest for understanding and creation, I have encountered innovations that are poised to disrupt our world. The startup Carbonaide, which aims to reinvent concrete by capturing CO2, AnythingLLM and its all-in-one AI, or Apple's strategy for a more powerful on-device AI than GPT-4, are examples of this. These technological advancements raise questions for me about their potential impact on our society and our planet.</p><p>The promise of Carbonaide to transform CO2 into stone for concrete resonates with me, as I believe that technology can help us combat climate change. However, I doubt the effectiveness of these solutions on a large scale, hence my insistence on the need for a change in behavior. AnythingLLM and Apple's AI showcase the tremendous potential of artificial intelligence to revolutionize our daily lives, simplify software development, and personalize the user experience. These advancements remind me of my own enthusiasm for ChatGPT, while underscoring the importance of privacy protection and responsible data usage.</p><p>These technological innovations compel us to question the future we desire. They prompt us to reflect on our relationship with technology, our responsibility to the planet, and our concept of progress. As a writer, as a thinker, I am fascinated by these questions, aware that each innovation is both a promise and a warning. Perhaps wisdom lies in navigating between these two extremes, not seeking to dominate nature or technology, but to live in harmony with them. "The future is not what will happen, but what we will make happen."</p><p><a href=/2024/04/08_en/source.txt>Source</a></p><p>Generation cost: <a href=https://openai.com/pricing>9612 tokens/0.07$</a></p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
