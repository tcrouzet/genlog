They propose a topos theory-based explanation for transformers' success, contrasting them with traditional neural networks. Transformers, residing in a topos completion, show higher-order reasoning abilities versus first-order logic in neural networks. The authors delve into expressivity differences, highlighting transformers' unique features like input-dependent weights through self-attention. The paper introduces architecture search and backpropagation in a categorical framework, elucidating transformers' dominance in language models.</p><p><a href=https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/humans-inhaling-microplastics-fibers-respiratory-health/ >Scientists make unsettling discovery deep within human bodies: 'Raises the concern of serious respiratory health hazards'</a></p><p>Microplastics, tiny fragments of plastic, are now being inhaled by humans, in addition to being consumed. A 2022 study found microplastics deep in human airways, raising concerns about respiratory health. Larger microplastics tend to get stuck in the nose and throat. Early research shows they harm cells, carry diseases, and cause health issues like reduced fertility and bowel inflammation. Researchers are developing advanced models to understand and mitigate the impact of microplastics on human health.</p><p><a href=https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/chatgpt-fine-tuning-api/ >OpenAI announce fine-tuning API and custom models program updates</a></p><p>OpenAI enhances fine-tuning API, empowering developers with unprecedented control over AI model training. Updates streamline creation of specialized AI models, improving performance for specific tasks. New epoch-based checkpoint system allows saving model states at different training stages. Comparative playground tool aids in evaluating and selecting the most effective model. Assisted fine-tuning services offered in custom models program for tailored models.</p><img src=https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-05-at-2.06.38-PM.png><h3>Generated text</h3><p>Artificial intelligence and microplastics, two articles that have nothing to do with each other, except that both have led me to reflect on the consequences of our technologies. I am both amazed and terrified by the tools we are inventing. I have tested ChatGPT, developed a text comparison API, and discussed with epidemiologists. I have witnessed a paradigm shift in our use of AI. We are striving to refine our tools, personalize them, make them more efficient. I wonder about their purpose, their impact on our creativity and independence.</p><p>Researchers at King's College London have theoretically analyzed neural network architectures. OpenAI has announced an update to their API. We are in pursuit of perfection. Microplastics are infiltrating our bodies. The unexpected consequences of our technologies are seeping into our society. We must maintain a critical eye on these technologies, on their impact on our environment, on the broader ecosystem in which we live. We must question, doubt, not blindly accept the promises of a better future simply because it is technologically advanced. The extraordinary lies in the ability to persuade oneself of an idea in which one already believes.</p><p>Generation cost: <a href=https://openai.com/pricing>10938 tokens/0.08$</a></p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
