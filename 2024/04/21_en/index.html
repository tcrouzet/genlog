BepiColombo's flyby of Venus provided data on the escape of carbon and oxygen ions from the planet's atmosphere. Positively charged carbon ions escaping Venus were observed for the first time, raising questions about the mechanisms involved. The study aims to understand how Venus's atmosphere has evolved and lost its water, using data from BepiColombo's instruments and Europlanet's SPIDER space weather modeling tools.</p><p><a href=https://www.sciencealert.com/antarctic-ice-shelf-the-size-of-france-suddenly-jumps-once-or-twice-a-day>Antarctic Ice Shelf The Size of France Suddenly Jumps Once or Twice a Day - ScienceAlert</a></p><p>Elastic waves in the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica cause significant daily movement, triggered by the Whillans Ice Stream. Sudden jumps in movement, up to 8 centimeters, are due to a loss of water underneath the stream. Slip events push against the ice shelf, similar to movements along fault lines before earthquakes. The long-term stability of the Ross Ice Shelf is crucial for the region's ice cover and sea level rise.</p><img src=https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/ShelfPhoto.jpg><h3>Generated text</h3><p>The universe never ceases to surprise me. I am here, witnessing these revelations that shake up our view of the world. The atmosphere of Venus emits oxygen and carbon. I have always loved the unknown, always wanted to know what was happening beyond our planet. Each new scientific discovery broadens our horizons, forces us to reposition ourselves. The carbon ions of Venus impress me as much as water on an exoplanet. The universe is in motion, and we know nothing.</p><p>And then, there is this story of Antarctica, a slab of ice the size of France that starts to move. I think of the Earth's fragility, of these imperceptible movements that, on our scale, seem insignificant, but which, on a geological scale, are devastating. Natural phenomena, like the movements of Antarctica or the emissions of Venus, remind us that nature follows its course, independently of us. They prompt me to reflect on our impact on the planet, on our need to rethink our relationship with it, to better listen to the signals it sends us.</p><p>Ultimately, whether I am scrutinizing Venus or Antarctica, I am amazed by the complexity of the universe. Scientific discoveries do not provide us with answers, they pose new questions. They urge us to be humble. We are only passengers of the universe, witnesses to its splendor. I have often thought that looking at clouds or cosmic phenomena was the same thing: seeking our place in immensity.</p><p>Generation cost: <a href=https://openai.com/pricing>7104 tokens/0.06$</a></p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
