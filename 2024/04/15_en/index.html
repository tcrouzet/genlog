He compared his awakening to a rebirth, rejecting sloth and distractions. Petrarch's ascetic lifestyle included minimal time for eating and grooming, multitasking by reading or writing during activities like shaving and riding.</p><p><a href=https://www.digitaltrends.com/space/earth-fate-white-dwarf/ >This is how the world ends: swallowed or shredded by a dying sun - Digital Trends</a></p><p>In billions of years, the sun will become a red giant, possibly engulfing Earth. Studying white dwarfs gives insight into Earth's fate in 5 billion years. Researchers observed debris around white dwarfs, revealing bodies like asteroids, moons, and planets torn apart by gravity. The behavior of these systems can evolve rapidly, with conditions changing in just a few years. Earth may be swallowed by an expanding sun, while asteroids and Jupiter's moons may undergo the shredding process near the white dwarf.</p><p><a href=https://www.livescience.com/space/the-sun/space-photo-of-the-week-nasa-spots-enormous-pink-flames-during-total-solar-eclipse-what-are-they>Space photo of the week: NASA spots enormous pink 'flames' during total solar eclipse. What are they? - Livescience.com</a></p><p>Towers of pink plasma rise from the sun during the April 8 total solar eclipse, about 93 million miles above Dallas. The eclipse, which occurred on April 8, 2024, was a rare event where Earth, the moon, and the sun aligned to create surreal darkness over North America. NASA photographer Keegan Barber captured the moment of totality over Texas, showing the sun's corona and chromosphere behind the moon. The pink structures seen are solar prominences, massive plasma towers that can stand taller than the Earth's diameter and emit a pinkish hue due to hydrogen.</p><img src=https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff60b301-a4b7-43dd-8381-e5d3558facc0_2602x2030.jpeg><h3>Analyse</h3><p>The insignificance of man in the face of the immensity of the universe. I rise, thinking of Petrarch who would rise at midnight to be reborn through intellectual work. I do as he did, I strive to transcend my condition, just as humanity seeks to understand the universe, as evidenced by articles about a world engulfed by a dying sun, solar eclipses with pink plasma flames, and Petrarch's ascetic routine. Cosmic and historical stories intertwine in my mind, underscoring our quest for meaning beyond our ephemeral lives.</p><p>Dying stars, solar eclipses, they bring me back to my own writings, where I explore the impact of technology and history on our perception of time and space. The end of the Earth, swallowed or torn apart, is not just a scientific prediction, it is a metaphor for our own end. The pink flames captured by NASA, fleeting witnesses of the cosmic dance, resonate with my reflections on the ephemeral beauty of existence. These moments of grace, when the cosmos reveals itself, remind us of our place in a universe that is indifferent to us.</p><p>Ultimately, these reflections on the universe and our quest for understanding bring me a serene acceptance of our condition. Like Petrarch rising at midnight to escape the death of sleep, we awaken to our insignificance, while celebrating our ability to contemplate the infinite. The universe continues its ballet, and we, ephemeral spectators, find meaning in our fleeting existence. "I am old as soon as I think of time," but in this age, I find a freedom: the freedom to seek, to question, and ultimately, to accept.</p><p>Generation cost: <a href=https://openai.com/pricing>11576 tokens/0.07$</a></p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
