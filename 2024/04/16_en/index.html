This approach could enhance the development of protein degraders for more potent cancer therapies. The study focuses on converting protein kinase inhibitors into degraders to combat resistance in cancer treatment. By designing molecular glues, researchers aim to target and degrade specific proteins, such as cyclin K, involved in cancer pathways. The team explored modifying a known degrader, CR8, to enhance its degradation capabilities and identified key components for improved efficiency. This research advances the understanding of designing monovalent degraders, potentially expanding their application to other kinase inhibitors for enhanced cancer treatment strategies.</p><p><a href=https://www.wionews.com/science/gravitational-waves-detect-collision-of-neutron-star-with-a-mysterious-object-in-mass-gap-710785>Gravitational waves detect collision of neutron star with a mysterious object in <code>mass gap</code> - WION</a></p><p>A neutron star collided with a mysterious lightweight object, larger than the biggest star but smaller than the smallest black hole. The event, detected 650 million light-years away, potentially revealed a surprisingly lightweight black hole. Detected by antennas in Japan, Italy, and the US, the collision was linked to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. This rare discovery suggests a new type of black hole within the elusive "mass gap", challenging existing astronomical beliefs.</p><img src=https://pmlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/the-icrs-sutton-campus.jpeg><h3>Generated text</h3><p>Science is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get. In the first article, researchers are turning cancer inhibitors into protein degraders, a major breakthrough. It reminds me of this idea of a medical thriller, where medicine hides unsettling truths. I never wanted to be confined to a single category, but scientific reality often surpasses fiction. The second article, with its stellar collision revealing a light black hole, makes me think of the insignificance and grandeur of our quest for understanding. The universe has this gift of reminding us how small we are, yet capable of contemplating the infinite.</p><p>These discoveries, whether in the fight against cancer or in cosmic mysteries, illustrate our insatiable curiosity and our desire to push the boundaries of knowledge. They emphasize the importance of looking beyond appearances, of questioning our certainties. Like when we discover water on an exoplanet or consider links between black holes and consciousness, each scientific advancement is an invitation to reimagine our place in the universe. It's this same energy that drives me to explore novel ideas where reality flirts with fiction, where a simple cyclist can become the hero of a genetic revolution.</p><p>Ultimately, science and literature are two sides of the same quest: to give meaning to our existence. They urge us to look beyond the horizon, to imagine possible worlds. And if, at times, they confront us with our own insignificance, they mainly remind us of our ability to dream, to create, to transform. As I have often thought, in a highly interconnected global world, one must be a bit reckless to wield the power of imagination.</p><p><a href=/2024/04/16_en/source.txt>Source</a></p><p>Generation cost: <a href=https://openai.com/pricing>7369 tokens/0.06$</a></p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
