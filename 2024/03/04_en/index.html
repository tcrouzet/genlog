The study's authors, Rick Battle and Teja Gollapudi, highlighted the surprising impact of these minor adjustments on the chatbots' performance. Published on arXiv, this experimental study underscores the influence of positive formulations on the outcomes of natural language processing machine learning models.</p><p><a href=https://futurism.com/the-byte/sam-altman-openai-tool-creature>Sam Altman Denies OpenAI Is Building AI "Creatures"</a></p><p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman discusses misconceptions about AI, whether it is perceived as a "creature" or a "tool." He distinguishes the risks associated with each, emphasizing the benefits of viewing AI as a tool in enabling humans to achieve remarkable feats. Altman hints at AI's potential as tools rather than autonomous entities, countering concerns about AI replacing jobs. Despite this narrative, Altman previously forecasted AI's ability to replace human workers and pointed out applications resembling "creatures," such as the conversational AI ChatGPT.</p><p><a href=https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/02/27/jonathan-franzen-spark-birds-orion/ >Jonathan Franzen on How to Write About Nature, with a Side of Rachel Carson and Alice in Wonderland</a></p><p>I fell in love with Wonderland as I grew up. My grandmother read it to me before I could read, and then I devoured it whenever I could. I loved its strangeness and tenderness. As a young mathematician, I cherished the fact that a mathematician had written it. What I loved most was Alice's fearless curiosity and compassion towards the creatures of Wonderland, like the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, and Bill the Lizard. What makes Wonderland so wonderful is Alice's awe-inspired perspective that reveals it to us, transforming this ordinary world into an extraordinary adventure. This quality of wonder is also the driving force of empathy.</p><p><a href=https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/baltic-odyssey/ >Was the “Odyssey” originally set in the Baltic?</a></p><p>If Ulysses had not wrapped himself in an abandoned cloak, he would have frozen to death in Troy. Eumaeus, the heroic swineherd, lent Ulysses a cloak because the night was once again freezing. Vinci reveals that the Homeric epics took place in the Baltic regions, not in Greece. According to him, these stories are set near the Baltic Sea, not in the Mediterranean. Vinci offers extraordinary evidence to support his claims, such as climatic anomalies and topographical correspondences.</p><img src=https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/MrSpockOnBridge.jpg><h3>Generated text</h3><p>Generation cost: Tokens: 8097 Dollars: 0.077356</p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
