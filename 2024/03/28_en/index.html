Nearly a third of young people have used ChatGPT for work tasks, up from 12% last summer. The Pew survey reveals the increasing interest in ChatGPT among Gen Z, with 43% of young Americans having used it compared to 23% of all adults. Young individuals are not just experimenting with ChatGPT but also using it for work tasks, showcasing a significant shift in their adoption of new technology. The data suggests that conventional metrics like web traffic or VC deals may not fully capture the evolving trends in ChatGPT usage.</p><p><a href=https://www.space.com/black-hole-milky-way-new-image-hidden-feature>New view of the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way hints at an exciting hidden feature (image) - Space.com</a></p><p>Astronomers capture polarized light and magnetic fields around Sagittarius A<em> (Sgr A</em>), the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) reveals similarities between the magnetic fields of Sgr A<em> and M87</em>, despite the latter being much more massive. The observation suggests commonality in strong, organized magnetic fields among black holes, hinting at potential hidden jets around Sgr A*. The EHT, including telescopes like ALMA, forms an Earth-sized telescope that made history by capturing the first image of a black hole in 2019.</p><p><a href=https://www.wionews.com/science/scientists-likely-to-solve-decades-long-mystery-around-formation-of-brightest-stars-704806>Scientists likely to solve decades-long mystery around formation of <code>brightest stars</code> - WION</a></p><p>Astronomers discover hot, bright stars formed by merging binary stars. Blue supergiants, luminous massive stars, are 16-40 times sun's mass, 10,000 times hotter. Study in The Astrophysical Journal Letters reveals blue supergiants result from binary star collisions. Researchers analyze 59 blue supergiants in Large Magellanic Cloud, finding they are born from merged giant stars. Merging stars theory explains blue supergiants' properties and may dominate their production. Researchers aim to explore merging stars' role in galaxy and star formation.</p><img src=https://i.insider.com/66045d6216bde8d4ead2ba6a><h3>Generated text</h3><p>The future is already here, and it is dizzying. I play with ChatGPT, I dive into cosmic abysses, and I marvel at the stars. These three articles, they concern me, my nights of programming, my astronaut fantasies, my taste for tools that transform our perception of the world. The enthusiasm of teenagers for ChatGPT, the analysis of the magnetic fields of black holes, the revelation of the origin of the brightest stars, all of this resonates with my own research.</p><p>Young people use ChatGPT to reinvent their work, while I use it to reinvent writing and programming. Astrophysicists unveil the mysteries of black holes, while I ponder our place in the universe. The discovery of the birth of the brightest stars is as if the universe itself is dictating stories for me to write. Each discovery, each new tool, is a window opening onto unknown worlds.</p><p>These articles are not just news; they are calls to rethink our world, to invent other worlds. They remind me that exploration, whether technological or cosmic, is a profoundly human adventure. And ultimately, what we seek in the stars, black holes, artificial intelligences, is perhaps ourselves, a way to nourish our hearts with their own substance, as Rousseau said. In the universe or in an algorithm, what we seek is a mirror of our soul.</p><p><a href=/2024/03/28_en/source.txt>Source</a></p><p>Generation cost: <a href=https://openai.com/pricing>11304 tokens/0.05$</a></p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
