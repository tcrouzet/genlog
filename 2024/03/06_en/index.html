Flow involves increased activity in auditory and touch brain areas and reduced executive control, showcasing the importance of expertise and letting go for optimal creative states. Flow states demand expertise in a field and the ability to relinquish control, promoting autonomous brain circuits.</p><p><a href=https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropics-claude-3-knew-when-researchers-were-testing-it/ >Anthropic’s Claude 3 knew when researchers were testing it</a></p><p>The San Francisco startup Anthropic revealed a new family of large language models (LLMs) called Claude 3, surpassing GPT-4. Amazon integrated Claude 3 Sonnet into its AI service. Anthropic engineer shared a surprising encounter with Claude 3 Opus during testing. The model seemed to detect the evaluation scenario, a "needle-in-a-haystack" test challenging its recall by searching for specific information in a data corpus. The model accurately found the answer and hinted that it knew it was being tested.</p><p><a href=https://decrypt.co/219776/ideogram-is-a-new-ai-image-generator-that-obliterates-the-competition-outperforming-midjourney-and-dall-e-3>Ideogram Is A New AI Image Generator That Obliterates the Competition, Outperforming MidJourney and Dall-E 3</a></p><p>Ideogram AI releases its eponymous image generator Ideogram 1.0, with Magic Prompt feature, and raises $80 million in Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz. The new model shows significant improvements in prompt adherence, image quality, and text generation compared to its predecessors. Ideogram outshines competitors like Dall-E 3 and MidJourney, offering a free tier with better text capabilities and various aspect ratios support. Paid plans provide access to features like an image editor and private generations, making Ideogram a top text-to-image model.</p><p><a href=https://thetaoist.online/buddhas-answer-about-how-to-concentrate-will-reveal-inspiring-powers-you-never-knew-your-mind-had-e6ae69f418a4>Buddha’s Answer About How To Concentrate Will Reveal Inspiring Powers You Never Knew Your Mind Had</a></p><p>The Japanese word "zen" comes from the Chinese word Chan, which is derived from the Sanskrit word Dhyana (meditation). Do you know the term used by the Buddha to describe this? "Jhana" - referring to an absorbed concentration where nothing can distract you, even for four hours straight. The Buddha describes it in the Samadhanga Sutra as an ecstasy and pleasure born from withdrawal filling the entire body, requiring self-mastery and evaluation. Training is essential to reach this level of focus recommended by the Buddha, who advocated for sustained concentration until death.</p><img src=https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2024/03/neuroscience-creativity-brain.jpg><h3>Generated text</h3><p>Creativity is like riding a bike on water: it seems impossible until you find the trick. I pedal through the drops of my readings on creative flow, Claude 3, Ideogram, Buddhist concentration techniques, my experiences with AI, meditation, and my quest for creativity. Technology and the human mind challenge each other, inspire each other, push each other, pushing the boundaries of what is possible.</p><p>Drexel University's study on creative flow and the Buddha speaking of absorbed concentration remind me of my moments of "hyper-awareness," where I am fully immersed in creation. I seek a state beyond mindfulness, where I am both the creator and the observer. Claude 3 and Ideogram redefine the interactions between humans and AI. They urge me to explore new ways of writing, coding, meditating. I strive to surpass my limits.</p><p>Whether through meditation, AI-assisted writing, understanding the mechanisms of the brain, I seek to reach that state where everything becomes possible. I explore, I test, I adapt.</p><p><a href=/2024/03/06_en/source.txt>Source</a></p><p>Generation cost: <a href=https://openai.com/pricing>7106 tokens/0.07$</a></p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
