Gravitational interaction between the planets causes 2.4-million-year cyclic changes in deep ocean currents, aiding climate prediction. These cycles are tied to Mars and Earth's orbits around the Sun. Scientists have identified a 2.4 million-year grand cycle related to Earth-Mars alignment. Planetary interactions alter eccentricity, influencing Earth's path and climate. Milankovitch cycles, linked to ice ages, are affected by Jupiter and Saturn, unlike the Mars-Earth interaction.</p><p><a href=https://futurism.com/artificial-life-lab-rna>Scientists Just Got Closer to Creating Artificial Life in the Lab</a></p><p>Researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies have made a breakthrough by creating a lab-made RNA molecule that can accurately copy others, bringing them closer to simulating early Earth conditions and the origins of life. The molecule, which mimics RNA's role in the "primordial soup," is a significant step towards understanding the earliest stages of evolution. Although not self-replicating yet, this achievement opens the door to potentially creating life in a controlled setting, with implications extending to the possibility of life emerging elsewhere in the universe. Maintaining precise RNA replication is crucial for Darwinian evolution, as errors can quickly lead to information loss and breakdown.</p><p><a href=https://bgr.com/science/new-computer-chip-made-with-dna-could-be-an-ai-breakthrough/ >New computer chip made with DNA could be an AI breakthrough</a></p><p>A new DNA-infused computer chip, featured in a PLOS One paper, utilizes DNA for data processing, going beyond mere data encoding. Researchers highlight DNA's compactness and reliability compared to traditional memory hardware. This breakthrough could revolutionize data storage and processing, potentially enhancing AI model training efficiency. The chip marks a significant advancement in utilizing DNA for computational tasks, hinting at a promising future for DNA-based technology.</p><img src=https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/Mars_horizon_space.jpg><h3>Texte généré</h3><p>Humanity, this apprentice sorceress, juggles with cosmic forces and the mysteries of life, without truly grasping the consequences of its actions. Once again, I find myself contemplating scientific advancements with a mix of fascination and apprehension. The article on oceanic cycles influenced by Mars reminds me of that night when I observed the red planet, shining with a particular brilliance, prompting me to reflect on our place in the universe and our constant interaction with cosmic forces. It's a delicate dance, a gravitational ballet of which we are only just beginning to understand the music.</p><p>And this quest to recreate life, as if we wanted to become laboratory gods. The experiment with the RNA molecule brings me back to my nocturnal thoughts on the colonization of distant planets by human embryos. We stand at a crossroads, between the creation of life and its spread to unknown worlds, flirting with the limits of our understanding and ethics. In our quest to decipher the mysteries of the universe, we may well redefine what it means to be alive.</p><p>The advent of a DNA-based computer chip underscores our fascination with the integration of the living and technology. This fusion of biology and computing reminds me of my own experiences with coding, the sensation of being absorbed into a parallel world where the boundaries between creator and creation blur. A world where possibilities seem endless, but where unanswered questions multiply just as much.</p><p>Generation cost: <a href=https://openai.com/pricing>27134 tokens/0.27$</a></p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
