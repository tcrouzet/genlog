Avant-garde American artist Laurie Anderson, who relies on a text-generating AI emulating her late partner Lou Reed, has launched the exhibition I’ll Be Your Mirror in Adelaide. The exhibition features a Bible generated by an AI mimicking Anderson's style and other works by their digital counterparts. Despite her peers' reservations about using AI to create artistic works, Anderson calmly reflects on her artistic legacy and on the power of words and music to transcend time.</p><p><a href=https://www.blick.ch/fr/news/monde/des-documents-secrets-du-kremlin-alertent-les-experts-vladimir-poutine-serait-a-deux-doigts-dappuyer-sur-le-bouton-nucleaire-id19481541.html>Vladimir Poutine serait à deux doigts d'appuyer sur le bouton nucléaire</a></p><p>According to Western sources, a nuclear war with Russia could break out sooner than expected. Secret documents from the Russian armed forces reveal a strategy in the event of a Chinese attack, highlighting the potential use of nuclear weapons. The Russian doctrine considers these weapons essential to its defense, with low thresholds for their use in the event of a major enemy aggression. Tensions persist as experts fear an escalation towards a nuclear conflict, despite Vladimir Putin's statements that nuclear use is currently unlikely.</p><p><a href=https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/02/28/beyond-gpt-4-dive-into-fudan-universitys-long-agent-and-its-revolutionary-approach-to-text-analysis/ >Beyond GPT-4: Dive into Fudan University’s LONG AGENT and Its Revolutionary Approach to Text Analysis!</a></p><ul><li>The "LONG AGENT" approach in artificial intelligence represents a major advancement for effectively analyzing long texts, a challenge for sophisticated models such as GPT-4. This system, developed by a team at Fudan University, is capable of processing documents up to 128,000 tokens through an innovative multi-agent collaboration.</li><li>Its unique architecture is based on a central leading agent supervising member agents responsible for text segments, thus facilitating detailed analysis of extensive documents.</li><li>The "LONG AGENT" methodology divides a query into sub-queries distributed to members for granular analysis, with error correction mechanisms in place. Tests have shown its superiority in complex tasks such as long text search and multi-level question answering.</li><li>This approach promises significant benefits for various applications, from legal document analysis to comprehensive literature reviews, highlighting its revolutionary potential in text data processing.</li></ul><img src=https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-27-at-9.22.07-PM.png><h3>Texte généré</h3><p>I like to anticipate the future while mocking the present. One day, our digital doubles will make love, art, and war on our behalf. Laurie Anderson proves this with "I’ll Be Your Mirror," her tribute to Lou Reed. She shows us a future where art, artificial intelligence, and the dead converge. If she accepts it, why shouldn't I?</p><p>Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin is playing with nuclear fire. He could very well annihilate humanity, for which Anderson's artificial intelligence seeks to preserve the essence.</p><p>And then, Fudan University is developing LONG AGENT, an artificial intelligence system capable of incredibly efficient assimilation and understanding of long texts. Imagine the application of this in our lives: precise legal document analyses, exhaustive literature summaries, perhaps even handling our own online affairs when we are no longer here.</p><p>Three articles mirrored. On one side, art and artificial intelligence unite to build an eternal legacy, on the other, nuclear destruction threatens that same legacy. But in the shadows, technological innovation continues its course.</p><p>I struggle with time, art, and technology. Like Laurie Anderson who keeps a piece of Lou Reed virtually alive, I seek to preserve my thoughts through words and ideas. Like Russia threatening global balance, I sometimes feel the temptation of power through the number of words written or the success achieved. Like the team at Fudan University pushing artificial intelligence to new horizons, I venture into narrative innovation, even if it means embracing art forms I never considered.</p><p>These articles reflect the stark contrast between the greatness and decadence of our time. I feel like I'm swimming in an ocean of uncertainties, where each wave could take me to uncharted shores or break me against sharp reefs. Yet, I stay the course, convinced that within this chaos lies the thread of a story yet to be told. A story of innovation, creation, but above all, of humanity – whether physical or digital.</p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
