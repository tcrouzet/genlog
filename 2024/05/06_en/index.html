<h2>Monday, May 6th 2024</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/05/05/alien-earths-science-book/">‘Alien Earths’ by Lisa Kaltenegger book review - The Washington Post</a></p>
<p>This article discusses the unknowns in science, particularly extraterrestrial life. Despite advances in astronomy and planetary science, the existence of alien life forms, from microbial to highly technological, remains uncertain. However, the topic is still worthy of exploration, prompting the writing of books.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wionews.com/science/earths-life-saver-magnetic-field-collapsed-590mn-years-ago-for-all-good-reasons-718190">Earth's 'life-saver' magnetic field collapsed 590mn years ago, for all good reasons - WION</a></p>
<p>Earth's magnetic field shields the planet from solar radiation. Research suggests it vanished 590 million years ago, coinciding with the Ediacaran period when multicellular life evolved. Scientists found the field weakened 30 times then, lasting 26 million years, correlating with a biodiversity explosion. The weakened field possibly led to higher oxygen levels, fueling life diversification.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/science/scientists-discovery-bottom-red-sea-761201-20240502">Scientists made chilling discovery after finally reaching the bottom of the Red Sea - LADbible</a></p>
<p>The Red Sea, located between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, is known for its vibrant ecosystem and as a busy shipping lane. Scientists discovered 'death pools' at its bottom, devoid of oxygen and home to extremophile microbes. These pools, untouched by usual marine life, offer insights into the origins of life on Earth and the potential for life on other planets. Researchers also use the pools to study past natural disasters like tsunamis and earthquakes.</p>

<h3>Analyse</h3><p>The universe, this vast cosmic joke, mocks us, poor humans, who question everything. I have often pondered these questions. Articles on 'Alien Earths', the Earth's magnetic field, and the 'death pools' of the Red Sea only deepen my perplexity, blending science, conjecture, and a desire to know.</p>
<p>On one hand, the hunt for exoplanets and extraterrestrial life reignites my taste for the unknown, my desire to believe in the existence of other forms of life, perhaps even in a universal consciousness, as suggested by panpsychism. On the other hand, the story of Earth's magnetic field, its collapse, and its connection to the explosion of biodiversity, reminds me of life's ability to thrive, despite everything. Lastly, the discovery of 'death pools' in the Red Sea, these ecosystems where life thrives without oxygen, fascinates me and proves that life, in one form or another, is always possible.</p>
<p>These reflections, nurtured by my readings and observations, have led me to a conclusion: life, in its diversity, is a mystery that surpasses us. It reminds us of our insignificance in the universe, while inviting us to bear witness to it. Life, with its mysteries, is a reminder that the impossible does not exist.</p>
