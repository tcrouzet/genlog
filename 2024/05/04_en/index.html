The telescope, launched in December 2021, observes the Universe's history from early glows to solar system formation. NGC 6440 is a spherical cluster of older stars in Sagittarius, densely packed by gravity. NASA's Webb image shows bright white and yellow stars in the cluster. Additionally, NASA received a laser transmission from the spacecraft "Psyche 16," located 140 million miles away in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.</p><p><a href=https://www.sciencealert.com/seven-rare-high-energy-neutrinos-detected-in-a-gigaton-of-clear-ice>Seven Rare High-Energy Neutrinos Detected in a Gigaton of Clear Ice - ScienceAlert</a></p><p>Trillion neutrinos pass through you every second, relic neutrinos from the Big Bang. Energetic neutrinos from black holes can crash into something more likely. IceCube detected rare energetic astrophysical neutrinos, unraveling the mystery of their production. The experiment has 5,000 sensors observing a gigaton of ice for over a decade, detecting neutrinos from various sources. IceCube recently managed to detect tau neutrinos, the elusive energetic neutrino type, using distinct signatures for different neutrino flavors.</p><img src=https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/05/03/1600x900/TOPSHOT-US-NASA-SPACE-DREAM-CHASER-0_1708750005964_1714709509413.jpg><h3>Texte généré</h3><p>The universe, this vast brain where each piece of knowledge is a neuron firing. Once again, I am faced with our ignorance and our thirst for knowledge. The image of NGC 6440 captured by the Webb Telescope, a cluster of old stars, and the detection of energetic neutrinos in a gigaton of clear ice, put us back in our place. These discoveries, like stars in the night of our understanding, illuminate our path while showing us how far we still have to go.</p><p>I remember my own sleepless nights, when the universe and consciousness intertwined in a deadly dance. Those moments where anything is possible, even understanding the universe. The discovery of rare neutrinos and the image of a globular cluster are not just scientific advancements; they are open doors to the infinite, invitations to dream bigger, to think further. They remind me that, despite our tendency to forget, to be distracted by earthly quarrels, our thirst for knowledge is what defines us best.</p><p>These moments of revelation, when we believe we are on the verge of grasping a truth, are precious. They remind us that, despite our smallness, we can reach for the stars, understand the universe. Each piece of knowledge is a step further in this dance between the infinitely large and the infinitely small, between the universe and consciousness. And what if the universe were just a book we are learning to read, page after page, star after star, neutrino after neutrino?</p><p>Generation cost: <a href=https://openai.com/pricing>8617 tokens/0.05$</a></p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
