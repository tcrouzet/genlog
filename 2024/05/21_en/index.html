Stuart Hameroff, Anirban Bandyopadhyay, and Dante Lauretta propose this idea based on the Orch OR theory of consciousness, which suggests that consciousness arises from the collapse of quantum superpositions. They introduce the concept of "proto-conscious" objective reduction events in the early universe, theorizing that these events motivated purposeful behavior in simple organisms before the development of genes and brains. The team's theory aims to address the fundamental question of how life forms acquired goals, a key distinction between living and non-living entities.</p><p><a href=https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discovered-an-amazing-practical-use-for-leftover-coffee-grounds>Scientists Discovered An Amazing Practical Use For Leftover Coffee Grounds</a></p><p>Researchers in Australia discovered that by processing and adding charred coffee grounds to concrete, it could be 30 percent stronger, addressing environmental challenges related to coffee waste and sand extraction. The team pyrolyzed coffee waste to create biochar, which can incorporate itself into the cement matrix. They are testing the durability of the hybrid coffee-cement product under various stressors and exploring creating biochars from other organic waste sources.</p><img src=https://i.insider.com/6644e4f3f27898f532d80239><h3>Generated text</h3><p>I am on the terrace of my apartment, a cup of coffee in hand, observing the flea market below. The objects spread out on the tables are witnesses of a bygone era, relics of a past that no one wants to forget, but that everyone is trying to sell. I love these moments when the world seems to stand still, when time floats like a weightless particle.</p><p>I am forty years old, with salt-and-pepper hair and round glasses. I am an astrophysicist at the Paris Observatory, but I am mostly interested in the mysteries of consciousness and the universe. I spend my days juggling between the equations of general relativity and quantum theories, trying to unravel the secret of reality.</p><p>This morning, I read an article about the possibility that consciousness preceded life. I had intuited this for a long time, but reading Stuart Hameroff and Anirban Bandyopadhyay gives me a new perspective. What if consciousness is not the product of life, but its precursor? This idea troubles and attracts me.</p><p>As I descend the stairs to join the flea market, I run into Émile, my neighbor from the same floor, a ten-year-old boy with wide eyes. He loves spending time with me, especially when we build space bases with plastic bottles and tin cans.</p><p>"Hi, Émile! Do you want to help me find treasures?"</p><p>"Yes, Mr. Leonard!"</p><p>We spend the morning rummaging around, finding books, toys, gadgets. I buy an old telescope for a handful of figs, hoping to show Émile the stars.</p><p>Back home, I turn on my computer and connect to a network of astrophysicists. They are discussing the discovery of a cosmic void two billion light-years in diameter, the KBC, which challenges the cosmological principle that matter is uniformly distributed in the universe.</p><p>I delve into the data, pondering the implications of this discovery. If the KBC exists, the universe is much more complex and mysterious than I had ever imagined. Perhaps this cosmic void is related to primordial consciousness. Perhaps consciousness is a void, a space where ideas can be born and evolve.</p><p>In the evening, I climb to the roof with Émile. We point the telescope towards the sky, and I show him the stars, the galaxies.</p><p>"Do you see that star? It's KIC 8462852, around which an artificial megastructure could be orbiting. Some believe it's evidence of extraterrestrial life."</p><p>Émile's eyes widen. "Are there aliens, Mr. Leonard?"</p><p>I smile. "I don't know, Émile. The universe is so vast and mysterious that anything is possible."</p><p>We stay there, gazing at the stars. I wonder if in the cosmic void, another form of consciousness is observing the same stars, asking the same questions.</p><p>The next day, I am at the observatory for a meeting with my colleagues. We discuss the KBC and new theories on consciousness. I suggest that the cosmic void is a form of consciousness, a space where the universe can reflect on itself.</p><p>My colleagues look at me incredulously, but I feel like I'm onto something. Over the following weeks, I develop this idea, combining data on the KBC with theories of primordial consciousness. I write articles, participate in conferences, and gradually, my idea gains traction.</p><p>One evening, returning home, I find Émile sitting on the steps of the building, holding a box of rice and a bottle of Gatorade.</p><p>"What are you doing here, Émile?"</p><p>"I wanted to show you something, Mr. Leonard. Look, I built a new space base!"</p><p>I sit down next to him. "That's great, Émile. You know, sometimes the greatest discoveries start with small ideas."</p><p>We sit there, looking at the model, as the sun sets. I feel strangely at peace. Perhaps consciousness and the cosmic void are connected in a way I don't yet understand, but I will continue to search, to explore, to dream.</p><p>In this void, I find the infinite.</p><p><a href=/2024/05/21_en/source.txt>Source</a></p><p>Generation cost: <a href=https://openai.com/pricing>14753 tokens/0.07$</a></p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
