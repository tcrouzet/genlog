Data analysis of seven red dwarfs within 900 light-years of Earth reveals unusual brightness, hinting at advanced civilizations. Freeman Dyson's 1960 theory suggests aliens could harvest star power using Dyson swarms. Further research identifies 53 similar cases up to 6,500 light-years away. Possible natural explanations include debris from planet formation or alignment with distant galaxies. Further studies aim to uncover the truth behind these mysterious signals.</p><p><a href=https://www.freethink.com/hard-tech/metamaterial>3D-printed “metamaterial” is stronger than anything in nature</a></p><p>Australian scientists create super strong, lightweight "metamaterial" inspired by plants like the Victoria water lily. The new material, made using advanced metal 3D-printing, has a lattice structure distributing load stress evenly. The metamaterial, fabricated from a titanium alloy, is 50% stronger than aerospace alloys. The team used laser powder bed fusion, a unique 3D printing technique, to create the metamaterial. Traditional manufacturing processes may hinder real-world applications initially, but as technology advances, wider implementation is expected.</p><p><a href=https://bigthink.com/hard-science/how-particle-accelerators-recreate-the-infant-universe/ >How particle accelerators recreate the Universe’s first moments</a></p><p>Particle accelerators recreate early Universe moments, revealing Big Bang insights. Experiments illuminate Universe evolution into star-filled cosmos. Blend of theoretical and experimental physics enhances understanding of earliest epochs. Large Hadron Collider accelerates protons to recreate hot early Universe conditions. Experiments explore Universe's transition from particle to nuclear physics eras. Inflation epoch, a period of faster-than-light expansion, remains theoretical.</p><img src><h3>Generated text</h3><p>I wake up with that familiar backup anxiety that grips me from time to time, like an old memory. To take my mind off things, I open my news aggregator. An article hits me like a punch: scientists have reportedly detected Dyson Spheres around certain stars. Suddenly, the universe seems more exciting to me.</p><p>I go for a bike ride. My gravel bike makes me feel like I'm gliding, but it's been forty years since I've ridden a racing bike. I can't stop thinking about this discovery. What if it's true? What if we're not alone?</p><p>Back home, I read another article: Australian scientists have invented a metamaterial stronger than anything found in nature. Inspired by plants, it could revolutionize the construction of everything, from airplanes to skyscrapers. I start to imagine a world where these two discoveries intersect.</p><p>Another article catches my eye: physicists are using particle accelerators to recreate the universe's first moments. We are on the cusp of a new era, where science fiction becomes reality.</p><p>I read, take notes, make hypotheses. What if Dyson Spheres were built with this metamaterial? What if particle accelerators helped us understand how they function?</p><p>I start writing a novel. Scientists discover a Dyson Sphere built with this metamaterial, and they use a particle accelerator to understand its workings. But they uncover more than they bargained for. The Dyson Sphere is not just an energy source; it's also a time-travel machine.</p><p>I spend nights writing. Isa tells me I'm stifling doubt with too much rationality. She may be right, but I want my novel to be believable, to make the reader question things and prepare them to enter the realm of fiction.</p><p>I finish my manuscript. I send it to my publisher. He calls me a few weeks later. He wants to publish my novel. Perhaps I managed to convey some of the excitement I felt when reading those articles.</p><p>What if it were true?</p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
