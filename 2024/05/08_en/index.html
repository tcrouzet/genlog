Social balance theory, originating in the 1940s, posits that individuals strive for equilibrium in relationships. It outlines rules like "friend of a friend is a friend" and "enemy of an enemy is a friend." Recent research, aligning with this theory, reveals the importance of constraints and individual positivity levels in modeling social networks accurately. The study, in Science Advances, sheds light on the mathematical underpinnings of social dynamics.</p><p><a href=https://www.universetoday.com/166889/new-evidence-for-our-solar-systems-ghost-planet-nine/ >New Evidence for Our Solar System's Ghost: Planet Nine - Universe Today</a></p><p>Researchers Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, along with Alessandro Morbidelli and David Nesvorny, present more evidence supporting the existence of Planet Nine (P9). Their paper, "Generation of Low-Inclination, Neptune-Crossing TNOs by Planet Nine," published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, discusses the anomalous dynamical structure in the solar system's distant reaches hinting at P9's presence. The study examines Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) with conventional orbits through N-body simulations, focusing on 17 well-quantified orbits from 29 objects in the Minor Planet Database. The researchers aim to use these objects as a probe for P9, conducting simulations with and without P9 in the Solar System.</p><img src=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php><h3>Texte généré</h3><p>The universe is not just stardust; it is also a vast network of relationships, a bit like on Facebook, but without the annoying game invitations. I often venture into reflections that take me far, very far, perhaps even to the collision that formed the Moon and initiated plate tectonics on Earth. This cataclysmic event, which shaped our world, reminds me that even in the most absolute chaos, there can be order, structure, a beginning. It's a bit like when I get lost in social networks, searching for a common thread, a logic in the midst of all the noise.</p><p>I come across this theory of balance in social networks, which makes me think of the search for balance in our lives. We all try to navigate this labyrinth of friendships and enemies, to understand who is with us and who is against us. It's a bit like in space, where planets and celestial objects follow trajectories dictated by invisible forces. And then, I think that maybe understanding social dynamics is a bit like trying to predict the position of a phantom planet in our solar system. It's complex, it's fascinating, and it's a bit frustrating too.</p><p>The supposed existence of Planet Nine, this mysterious object that would influence everything from the shadows, makes me reflect on the invisible yet profound impact that certain elements can have on our lives. It's like those mysterious blobs inside the Earth, or those lost friends we find on LinkedIn. We don't see them, but they are there, influencing our trajectory. And in the midst of all this, I remember that, despite our quest for understanding, connection, and discovery, we are all a bit like solitary explorers in the vastness of the universe, seeking our place, our orbit, our path. As Lisa Cron said, we seek to navigate reality, and sometimes, it's by gazing at the stars that we find our way.</p><p>Generation cost: <a href=https://openai.com/pricing>9761 tokens/0.06$</a></p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
