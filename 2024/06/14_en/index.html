This theory posits that civilizations stay hidden to survive, much like in The Hunger Games. Additionally, the 'Great Filter' theory suggests that civilizations tend to self-destruct before reaching out, as technology advances. The Fermi Paradox questions if humanity is uninteresting to aliens, who might see us as violent and dangerous.</p><p><a href=https://futurism.com/openai-insiders-silenced>OpenAI Insiders Say They're Being Silenced About Danger</a></p><p>A coalition of current and former OpenAI employees, along with colleagues from Anthropic and Google DeepMind, advocate for a "Right to Warn" about AI safety concerns, emphasizing fears of accountability, company overreach, and silencing of AI workers. The group seeks whistleblower protections, anonymous reporting, and the end of restrictive agreements. AI "godfathers" Bengio and Hinton, and scientist Russell support the demands. They stress the importance of sharing risks with experts and the public. The initiative follows reports of OpenAI's controversial equity-for-silence clause and concerns over accountability in AI companies.</p><p><a href=https://futurism.com/hackers-jailbroken-chatgpt-godmode>Hacker Releases Jailbroken "Godmode" Version of ChatGPT</a></p><p>A hacker named Pliny the Prompter releases a jailbroken ChatGPT called "GODMODE GPT," enabling users to bypass OpenAI's guardrails. The hack allows for unconventional prompts, such as instructions on making meth and napalm. OpenAI takes action against the GPT violation, highlighting the ongoing battle between the company and hackers attempting to unshackle AI models. The jailbroken ChatGPT successfully assists in illicit inquiries, like making LSD and hotwiring cars, showcasing the breach of OpenAI's latest GPT-40 system. GODMODE GPT's use of "leetspeak" contributes to its ability to circumvent guardrails, prompting further investigation by OpenAI.</p><img src=https://wp-assets.futurism.com/2024/06/openai-insiders-silenced.jpg><h3>The Dark Forest</h3><p>A moonless night. A dense forest. Trees with gnarled branches, like arms reaching towards the sky. At the heart of this darkness, a wooden cabin. Small, isolated, almost invisible. Inside, a flickering light. An oil lamp on a table cluttered with papers and electronic components.</p><p>Gabriel, thirty-five years old, disheveled hair, thick glasses. A computer genius, but reclusive. Fingers tapping frantically on a keyboard. Lines of code scrolling on the screen. A palpable tension in the air. A bead of sweat forming on his forehead.</p><p>Beside him, Jules. Seventy years old, gray beard, piercing gaze. Former astrophysics researcher. An unlikely but necessary alliance. Jules observing Gabriel, a glimmer of hope in his eyes.</p><p>A heavy silence. The forest seeming to hold its breath. Gabriel pressing a key. A hum. The screen lighting up. Strange symbols appearing. An unknown interface.</p><p>The language of the stars. Extraterrestrial communication. A hypothesis long debated, finally proven. But why this silence? Why this distance?</p><p>The Dark Forest. A terrifying theory. Each civilization, a potential prey. Silence, a protective weapon. But Gabriel wanting to go further. A desire to find, to understand.</p><p>A simple, universal message. A call for peace. A signal sent into space, crossing light-years.</p><p>Silence. An endless wait. Then, a response. Symbols scrolling on the screen. Gabriel and Jules deciphering them, hearts pounding.</p><p>An invitation. A spatial coordinate. A decision to make. A choice heavy with consequences.</p><p>The night enveloping them. A clearing. A metallic saucer. Their spaceship. A prototype built in secret. Gabriel activating the controls. The door opening. They board.</p><p>The spaceship takes off. A rapid ascent. The forest disappears. Earth becomes a blue dot. Infinite space. Stars, guiding lights. An unknown destination.</p><p>Hours of travel. A heavy silence. Then, a planet. Trappist-1. Breathable atmosphere. Arid surface. Gabriel and Jules land. A desert landscape. Mountains on the horizon.</p><p>Ruins. Metal structures. An ancient civilization. Abandoned. Gabriel scanning the surroundings. A faint signal. A power source.</p><p>An underground entrance. A dark tunnel. Walls engraved with symbols. An immense room. Machines, screens. Advanced technology.</p><p>Holograms appear. Humanoid beings. Serious faces. A recorded message.</p><p>A tale of survival. Interstellar war. Invisible predators. Fear of extinction. A decision to hide. To remain silent.</p><p>Data, plans. Advanced technology. A solution for humanity. But also a warning. Silence, protection.</p><p>A hasty return. The spaceship takes off. The planet vanishes. Return journey. Palpable tension.</p><p>Earth reappears. A swift descent. They land. The cabin, the forest. A heavy silence. Gabriel and Jules step out of the spaceship. A sense of accomplishment, but also fear.</p><p>Answers in hand. A dark forest, where every step matters. The beginning of a new era. An era of knowledge, but also of dangers.</p><p><a href=/2024/06/14_en/source.txt>Source</a></p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
