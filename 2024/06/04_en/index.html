Traditional night-vision technology involves converting photons into electrons through a complex system, making it impossible to shrink into a thin film. TMOS's metasurface-based upconversion technology simplifies this process, allowing for clearer night vision without the need for electron conversion or cryogenic cooling. This innovation presents opportunities for various industries and signifies a shift towards smaller, lighter, and more efficient night-vision technology.</p><p><a href=https://futurism.com/the-byte/capitalists-alarmed-renewables-electricity-free>Capitalists Alarmed as Renewables Keep Making Electricity Temporarily Free</a></p><p>Investors worry about consumers benefiting from free electricity.

The lenses were so thin that they seemed almost invisible. She stood by the window, observing the city shrouded in darkness. A revolutionary technology, they said. She no longer needed the heavy night vision binoculars she used for her investigative journalism work. A thin film applied to her regular glasses was now enough to pierce the darkness.</p><p>Léa, an investigative journalist, had always been fascinated by the hidden mysteries of the night. Her investigations had taken her to dark and dangerous places, but she had never backed down. That evening, she had a meeting with an anonymous informant. A man who claimed to have crucial information about a conspiracy involving energy companies and corrupt politicians.</p><p>She left her apartment, descended the spiral staircase, and stepped out onto the street. The rain was falling gently, creating shimmering reflections on the cobblestones. She walked quickly, avoiding puddles, until she reached a discreet café on the corner. Inside, she immediately spotted the man. A face marked by years, piercing eyes, a nervous demeanor. His name was Marc.</p><p>Léa sat across from him, took out her notebook and pen, ready to jot down every word.</p><ul><li>Are you Léa? he asked in a hoarse voice.</li></ul><p>She nodded.</p><ul><li>What I have to tell you is dangerous. They're watching everything.</li></ul><p>Marc told her how energy companies manipulated electricity prices, creating artificial shortages to maximize their profits. He spoke of bought politicians, sabotaged bills, silenced researchers. Léa listened attentively, noting every detail. She knew that this information could bring down heads, but also put her own life in danger.</p><ul><li>You must be careful, added Marc as he got up to leave. They won't hesitate to do anything to protect their interests.</li></ul><p>Léa sat alone for a moment, reflecting on what she had just heard. She knew this investigation would be risky, but she couldn't back down. She left the café, her new glasses allowing her to see clearly in the night. She headed to her office, where she would spend the next few hours verifying Marc's information.</p><p>The following days were intense. Léa contacted sources, cross-checked information, searched for evidence. Each discovery brought her closer to the truth, but also to danger. One evening, as she worked late, her phone rang. An unknown number.</p><ul><li>Léa, it's Marc. They know you're investigating. You need to hide.</li></ul><p>The line abruptly cut off. Léa felt a surge of adrenaline. She knew she had to act fast. She gathered her notes, stored them in an encrypted folder on her computer, and hastily left her office. She went to a trusted friend's place, Paul, a former hacker turned cybersecurity consultant.</p><ul><li>Léa, what's going on? asked Paul, seeing her arrive out of breath.</li></ul><p>She quickly explained the situation to him. Paul immediately understood the gravity of the situation. He helped her secure her data, erase her digital traces, and prepare a plan to publish her findings without being detected.</p><ul><li>You'll have to be careful, Léa. They have means you can't even imagine.</li></ul><p>In the following days, Léa hid at Paul's place, continuing her investigation online, using secure networks and fake identities. She published her articles under a pseudonym, exposing the dark machinations of energy companies and corrupt politicians to the world. The reactions were immediate and violent. The media picked up the story, investigations were launched, heads began to roll.</p><p>But Léa knew the danger was not over. One evening, as she worked late, she heard a suspicious noise outside. She put on her night vision glasses and looked out the window. Two men in black suits, armed, were searching the area. She realized they were looking for her.</p><ul><li>Paul, they're here, she whispered, turning to him.</li></ul><p>Paul activated a security program he had installed for such a situation. The lights went out, the surveillance cameras turned on, recording every movement outside. Léa and Paul prepared to flee. They left the apartment through a back door, blending into the shadows of the night.</p><p>They spent several days in hiding, constantly changing locations, using secure communication methods. Léa continued to publish her articles, revealing more and more details about the conspiracy. The energy companies and corrupt politicians were cornered, but they had not had the last word.</p><p>One evening, as they hid in an abandoned warehouse, Léa received a encrypted message on her computer. An invitation to a secret meeting with a high-ranking official who claimed to want to testify. Paul was skeptical, but Léa knew she had to take the risk. They went to the meeting place, an old abandoned factory on the outskirts of the city.</p><p>Léa entered alone, her night vision glasses allowing her to see clearly in the darkness. She advanced cautiously, her senses on high alert. Suddenly, a figure appeared in front of her. A man in a suit, a cold smile on his lips.</p><ul><li>You're tougher than I thought, Léa, he said as he approached.</li></ul><p>Léa stepped back, sensing imminent danger. She knew she had to act fast. She took a small device out of her pocket, a security device that Paul had given her. She pressed the button, triggering a deafening alarm. The man stepped back, surprised, and Léa took the opportunity to flee.</p><p>She ran through the factory, her glasses allowing her to see every obstacle. She rejoined Paul outside, and they fled in a car. They knew they couldn't stay in the city any longer. They headed to a small isolated house in the countryside, a refuge that Paul had prepared.</p><p>Léa continued to publish her articles from their hideout, determined to reveal the truth. The energy companies and corrupt politicians were eventually arrested, thanks to the evidence she had gathered. But Léa knew she would never be safe. She had made powerful enemies, and they would never forget her.</p><p>She looked at Paul, grateful for his help and support. Together, they had managed to bring down a conspiracy, but the price to pay was high. Léa knew she had to remain hidden, but she had no regrets. She had chosen the truth, and she would continue to fight for it, in the shadows, with her night vision glasses to pierce the darkness.</p><p><a href=/2024/06/04_en/source.txt>Source</a></p><p>Generation cost: <a href=https://openai.com/pricing>14041 tokens/0.06$</a></p></main><footer><p>(cc0) <a href=https://tcrouzet.com/ >Thierry Crouzet</a> 2024</p></footer></body></html>
